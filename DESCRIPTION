Description: TSLite provides a lightweight extension to the TrialSimulator 
 package. While TrialSimulator has already undergone substantial testing and 
 offers a comprehensive infrastructure with advanced tools for clinical trial 
 simulation, TSLite focues on delivering a thoroughly tested subset of its 
 functionality. It wraps validated functions to support reliable and efficient 
 trial simulation. Over time, more tools and functions from TrialSimulator 
 will be incorporated into TSLite once they have passed rigorous testing.
